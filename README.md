# PWM audio
bare metal arudino audio player with PWM

# Setup
`sudo apt install avr-libc avrdude avr-gcc`

# Notes
## Avr-libc paths
`/usr/lib/avr`  
`/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/[iom328p.h]` - definitions for different microcontrollers  

## Notes on USART
* synchronous seems to be called SPI
* async is 'simpler'
